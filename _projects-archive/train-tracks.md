A web app for visualising train movement between Sheffield and London St. Pancras using WebGL. Built in 24 hours. 1st winner of the [BullHacks 2017 MLH hackathon](https://devpost.com/software/train-tracks).

This project later inspired my dissertation on predicting train congestion on the UK railway network.
