          <p>I have begun the development of a new HTML 5 and JavaScript based stop motion animation program. The working title for now is simply Boats Animator – this reflects the alias “Boats Are Rockable” that I use in the brickfilming community.</p>

<p>My intention is to have a web app version of Boats Animator hosted on this site and also an installable desktop version available.</p>

<p>The main aims for Boats Animator are to provide a light weight and modern looking stop motion animation program that is free and easy to use. I also wish to use this product as a means of improving my skills in JavaScript and HTML 5.</p>

<p>This blog will be used to post updates on the progress of Boats Animator.</p>
