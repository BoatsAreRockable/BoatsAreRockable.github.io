          <p>I continue to work on Boats Animator, however this is no longer alone as the project is now available for contribution on <a href="https://github.com/BoatsAreRockable/animator" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Development has continued mostly to the back-end workings of the program which in the progress of being greatly cleaned up. This clean-up has come about from me being a JavaScript newcomer and while BA functioned fine there were a number of best practises that were not being followed. GitHub has allowed more experienced developers to bring these to my attention and in addition help implement new functionality to the program.<figure style="width: 458px" class="wp-caption alignleft"></figure></p>

          <p>Boats Animator has been created using HTML 5 and JavaScript which means in theory it should work in any web browser on any operating system. Right now it pretty much does in the Windows versions of Chrome Desktop, Firefox Desktop, Opera and even Microsoft Edge. I am sure it will also work in the browsers mentioned before that have Mac and Linux versions.</p>

          <p>I am happy to say progress has continued on Boats Animator (although perhaps at the detriment of my other studies…). The main thing I have been working on has been improving frame playback. As you can see playback now occurs in a second window next to the capture one and I have fixed quite a few bugs that were occurring when the play, pause and stop buttons were pressed multiple times. You may also notice a few more interface improvements such as the delete icons in the corner of each captured frames, the new status bar with how many frames have been captured and the current fps and the arrows (which need resizing still) to scroll through the captured frames.<a href="http://charlielee.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Boats-Animator-0.3.0-screenshot-1.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-347 alignright" src="http://charlielee.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Boats-Animator-0.3.0-screenshot-1-510x340.png" alt="Boats Animator 0.3.0 screenshot 1" width="510" height="340" srcset="http://charlielee.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Boats-Animator-0.3.0-screenshot-1-510x340.png 510w, http://charlielee.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Boats-Animator-0.3.0-screenshot-1-300x200.png 300w, http://charlielee.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Boats-Animator-0.3.0-screenshot-1-690x460.png 690w, http://charlielee.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Boats-Animator-0.3.0-screenshot-1-980x653.png 980w, http://charlielee.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Boats-Animator-0.3.0-screenshot-1.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /></a></p>

          <p>I have begun the development of a new HTML 5 and JavaScript based stop motion animation program. The working title for now is simply Boats Animator – this reflects the alias “Boats Are Rockable” that I use in the brickfilming community.</p>
