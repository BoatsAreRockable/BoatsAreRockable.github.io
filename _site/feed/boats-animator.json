With NW.js I can make Boats Animator appear like a native program with proper “File”, “Edit”, “Help”, etc menus, have better open and saving features and native pop up windows. NW.js’s Chromium basis means that Boats Animator will function in it almost exactly the same way as it does in Google Chrome and this means that the issues I mentioned above will also not occur.<\/p> <p>So as well as making Boats Animator feel like a native application using NW.js will also sort out the cross-browser issues it will eventually have.<\/p> <p><strong>In summary Boats Animator will come in the form of a downloadable ZIP folder and will work on Windows, Mac and Linux based computers.<\/strong><\/p>", "excerpt": "<p>Boats Animator has been created using HTML 5 and JavaScript which means in theory it should work in any web browser on any operating system.
