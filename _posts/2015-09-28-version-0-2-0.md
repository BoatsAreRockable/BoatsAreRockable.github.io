I am still working on getting Boats Animator into a fully useful state. So far the following features have been implemented:

  * Frame capturing
  * Frame sequencing
  * Undo last frame captured
  * Preview captured frames (with the option to loop the preview and select playback frame rate)
  * Onion skinning
  * Download last frame captured

The capture preview feature works but is certainly not in its final form and I am not happy with how the download last frame feature works.

In addition 3 other major features that need to be added before any kind of public release are:

  * The ability to select a video source in a native interface (rather than that of the browser)
  * The ability to select video resolution
  * The ability to export the frames captured as a video file.

I have no doubt that it will take me some time to figure out how to implement these features. Also I&#8217;ve attached a screenshot of the program just to prove I am actually working on something!

Hopefully I can keep you informed about Boats Animator&#8217;s development a bit more frequently from now on&#8230;
