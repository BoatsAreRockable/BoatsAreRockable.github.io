I am looking for photos of people's studio setups with Boats Animator, as well screenshots of the program during production, so I can use in places such as the Boats Animator website. I am also interested on getting people's feedback on using the program. If you have got 2 minutes to spare, please consider giving your thoughts and uploading a few images to the 2019 Boats Animator User Survey (click the title of this news item to view the survey link, if viewing this message from within Boats Animator).
