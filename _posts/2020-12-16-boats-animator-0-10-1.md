[Boats Animator 0.10.1](https://github.com/charlielee/boats-animator/releases/tag/v0.10.1) is now available. This minor release fixes video export not working if the folder path contains spaces.

Behind the scenes, I am currently working on moving the app from NW.js to Electron. This is a much better supported tool and should pave the way for big features in the future such as project support.
