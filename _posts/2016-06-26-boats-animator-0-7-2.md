[Boats Animator 0.7.2](https://github.com/BoatsAreRockable/Boats-Animator/releases/tag/v0.7.2) is now available. This versionÂ add frame numbers above frame reel thumbnails and restyles the scrollbars in the program.

There have also been a number of improvements to Boats Animator&#8217;s build process; this greatly streamlines the process of releasing new versions and will allow more time to be spent on implementing new features.
