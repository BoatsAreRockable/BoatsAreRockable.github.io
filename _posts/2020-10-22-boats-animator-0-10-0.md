[Boats Animator 0.10.0](https://github.com/charlielee/boats-animator/releases/tag/v0.10.0) is now available. This version brings exports to video, short play and you don't need to change directory every time you start the app anymore.

Captured frames now have a unique id in their file names that is generated on start up. This removes the risk of overwriting data and removes the need for the "current save directory already contains captured frames!" warning message.
