[Boats Animator 0.8.2](https://github.com/BoatsAreRockable/boats-animator/releases/tag/v0.8.2) is now available. This minor update adds an warning message if the current save directory already has frames in it. This is to ensure users do not accidentally overwrite frames.

A future update will add a projects feature that should reduce the need for this warning to be displayed.
