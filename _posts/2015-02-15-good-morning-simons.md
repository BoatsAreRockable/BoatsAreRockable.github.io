This was an entry to the THAC XII competition on <a href="http://bricksinmotion.com/" target="_blank">bricksinmotion.com</a>, it was made in under 24 hours and was my first brickfilm for 2 years. Despite the oddness of the film I am actually quite proud of it, particularly considering the time limitations of the contest.
