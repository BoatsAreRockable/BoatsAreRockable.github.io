[Boats Animator 0.7.4](https://github.com/BoatsAreRockable/boats-animator/releases/tag/v0.7.4) is now available. This is a minor release which removes the onion skinning button (onion skinning is now activated by simply moving the slider) and fixes a bug which meant the first frame captured was not stored in certain scenarios.
