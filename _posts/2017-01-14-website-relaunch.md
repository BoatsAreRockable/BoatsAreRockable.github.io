I have decided to move my Wordpress website to Jekyll. Wordpress is unnecessarily heavyweight for what I use the site for and worrying about updating plug-ins and things is a bit of pain. In addition, I'm paying a few pounds a month for web hosting I really do not need!

I have moved over the majority of the old site's content now. Please [let me know](contact) if you come across any issues with this site.
