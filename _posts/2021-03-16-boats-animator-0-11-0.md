[Boats Animator 0.11.0](https://github.com/charlielee/boats-animator/releases/tag/v0.11.0) is now available. This is an important behind the scenes update which moves Boats Animator from NW.js to Electron.

Some changes you may notice are:

* Easier to install on macOS and Linux - you can now download .dmg and .deb packages
* A more "native" feel - Boats Animator now looks and feels more like the other programs on your computer
* New documentation - check out the revamped user guide for Boats Animator
* Better security - all web links are now HTTPS and the app integrates better with macOS and Windows' camera access settings
