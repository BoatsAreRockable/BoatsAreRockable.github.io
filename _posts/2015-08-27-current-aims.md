Right now I am working towards getting Boats Animator into a usable state. I would like to implement most of the following features for the 1.0.0 release:

  * Interface to choose a webcam
  * Display of live feed of webcam
  * Capture frame from live feed and add to array
  * Display array as image sequence
  * Display last frame of array for onion skinning
  * Ability to delete unwanted frames via list and undo last frame button
  * Render image sequence to webM format via whammy.js

The current time scale for completing this work is by the end of September although this is subject to change.
