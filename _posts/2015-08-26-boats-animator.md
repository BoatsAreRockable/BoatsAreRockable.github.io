I have begun the development of a new HTML 5 and JavaScript based stop motion animation program. The working title for now is simply Boats Animator &#8211; this reflects the alias &#8220;Boats Are Rockable&#8221; that I use in the brickfilming community.

My intention is to have a web app version of Boats Animator hosted on this site and also an installable desktop version available.

The main aims for Boats Animator are to provide a light weight and modern looking stop motion animation program that is free and easy to use. I also wish to use this product as a means of improving my skills in JavaScript and HTML 5.

This blog will be used to post updates on the progress of Boats Animator.
