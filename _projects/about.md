Hi I'm Charlie and I have decided to move my Wordpress website to Jekyll. Wordpress is unnecessarily heavyweight for what I use the site for and worrying about updating plug-ins and things is a bit of pain. In addition, I'm paying a few pounds a month for web hosting I really do not need!

I'm currently in the progress of migrating over the old website's content but in the mean time feel free to visit [charlielee.uk](http://charlielee.uk/).
