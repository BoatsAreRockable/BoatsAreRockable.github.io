As part of an Internet of Things module at university, I created a multiplayer version of the classic game Battleships for the "unPhone". The unPhone is a connected Arduino-like device, powered by the ESP32 micro-controller and Adafruit kits.

This was a joint assignment with my friend and coursemate Ben Scott.
