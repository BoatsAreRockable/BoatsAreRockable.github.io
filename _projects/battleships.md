As part of an Internet of Things module at university, I created a multiplayer version of the classic game Battleships for the "unPhone". The "unPhone" is a connected device powered by the ESP32 micro-controller and Adafruit kits. The ESP32 has an Arduino compatiblity layer, so Arduino C was used for development.

This was a joint assignment with my friend and coursemate Ben Scott.
