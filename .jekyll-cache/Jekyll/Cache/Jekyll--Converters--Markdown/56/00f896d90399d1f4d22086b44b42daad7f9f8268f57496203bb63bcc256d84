I"¦<p><a href="https://github.com/charlielee/boats-animator/releases/tag/v0.10.1">Boats Animator 0.10.1</a> is now available. This minor release fixes video export not working if the folder path contains spaces.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, I am currently working on moving the app from NW.js to Electron. This is a much better supported tool and should pave the way for big features in the future such as project support.</p>
