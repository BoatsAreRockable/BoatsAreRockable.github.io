I"q<p>I continue to work on Boats Animator, however this is no longer alone as the project is now available for contribution on <a href="https://github.com/BoatsAreRockable/animator">GitHub</a>. Development has continued mostly to the back-end workings of the program which in the progress of being greatly cleaned up. This clean-up has come about from me being a JavaScript newcomer and while BA functioned fine there were a number of best practises that were not being followed. GitHub has allowed more experienced developers to bring these to my attention and in addition help implement new functionality to the program.</p>
