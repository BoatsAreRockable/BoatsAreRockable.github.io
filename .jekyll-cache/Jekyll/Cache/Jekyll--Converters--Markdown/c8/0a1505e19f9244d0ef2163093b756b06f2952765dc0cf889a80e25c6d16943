I"¥<p>I am happy to say progress has continued on Boats Animator (although perhaps at the detriment of my other studiesâ€¦). The main thing I have been working on has been improving frame playback. As you can see playback now occurs in a second window next to the capture one and I have fixed quite a few bugs that were occurring when the play, pause and stop buttons were pressed multiple times. You may also notice a few more interface improvements such as the delete icons in the corner of each captured frames, the new status bar with how many frames have been captured and the current fps and the arrows (which need resizing still) to scroll through the captured frames.</p>
