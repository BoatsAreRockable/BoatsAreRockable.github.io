I"·<p>I have decided to move my Wordpress website to Jekyll. Wordpress is unnecessarily heavyweight for what I use the site for and worrying about updating plug-ins and things is a bit of pain. In addition, Iâ€™m paying a few pounds a month for web hosting I really do not need!</p>

<p>I have moved over the majority of the old siteâ€™s content now. Please <a href="contact">let me know</a> if you come across any issues with this site.</p>
