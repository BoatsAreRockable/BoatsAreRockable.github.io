I"[<p><a href="https://github.com/BoatsAreRockable/boats-animator/releases/tag/v0.7.4">Boats Animator 0.7.4</a> is now available. This is a minor release which removes the onion skinning button (onion skinning is now activated by simply moving the slider) and fixes a bug which meant the first frame captured was not stored in certain scenarios.</p>
