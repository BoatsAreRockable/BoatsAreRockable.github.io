I"l<p>Boats Animator has been created using HTML 5 and JavaScript which means in theory it should work in any web browser on any operating system. Right now it pretty much does in the Windows versions of Chrome Desktop, Firefox Desktop, Opera and even Microsoft Edge. I am sure it will also work in the browsers mentioned before that have Mac and Linux versions.</p>
