<p><em>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very user-friendly, fast, and has a minimal design that keeps me focused on animating. I also like that it‚Äôs able to utilize the maximum resolution my webcam outputs‚Ä¶‚Äù</em></p>

<p><em>‚ÄúOn the whole, this program looks very promising, and we were mostly impressed by its intuitive, novice-friendly design. Once the missing features are implemented, this will be an excellent alternative to overly complex or expensive stop-motion animation tools.‚Äù</em></p>

<h2 id="ryan">Ryan</h2>

<p><em>‚ÄúI love the onion skinning‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶I‚Äôm glad I found this as it‚Äôs something that still being worked on!‚Äù</em></p>

<h2 id="owen-garcia">Owen Garcia</h2>

<p><em>‚ÄúI make brickfilms (Lego stop motion movies) and Boats Animator is perfect for it. I love that it has onion skinning, grid overlay, and 1920x1080 support. Boats Animator is great and I think anyone, pro or beginner, should use this wonderful program.‚Äù</em></p>
