## Brickfilms Wiki

I was heavily involved in creating the [Brickfilms Wiki](http://brickfilms.wikia.com) - an encyclopaedia about LEGO stop motion animated films. The majority of my work wasÂ creating CSS, JavaScript and templates.

## Films

Over the years I've created a number of stop motion animations using LEGO, also known as brickfilms.

## Music

For a number of years I have played the clarinet and piano, however I have recently become interested in music composition.
